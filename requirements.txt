TODO:
  Features:
  - Need to put into keyword icon support (large and small)
  - Need to add guassianblur to sides and bottoms of card images
  - Have not yet done formatting for tribes or champion levelup bars
  - base text size for names is still unknown
  - Support for spells and their positional constants has not even been
    attempted yet

  Other:
  - The naive PIL draw is bad, look into aggdraw to get proper anti-aliasing
  - Code is VERY messy needs a reorganization, especially the definitions.py
  - much of the lor-template-pack is bloated and with bad file paths,
    should slim it and reorganize
  - no real documentation lmaooo
